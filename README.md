# Prime-Time-Trivia-Finder
Today what is important to most product or service based companies is users’ engagement. 
Millions of dollars are spent on advertising of products just to get those 5-10 seconds of users’ attention.
But getting users’ attention is not such a trivial task. You need to come up with an out of box idea to stand out.
Here Interesting Trivias come into picture. Interesting Trivias are proven methods for getting users’ attention and keeping them engaged. 
You can see proof of this at many places.
For example, Flipkart recently launched a ‘Trivia Tuesday’ contest. Winners get gift prizes on answering Interesting Trivia related questions. 
This not only helped Flipkart in getting a high number of visits to their website on a regular basis but also helped them advertise their flagship events like ‘Big Billion Sale’.
Another example of Interesting Trivias is IMDB. 
IMDB is a popular source for movies, TV and celebrity content. 
For each movie, TV show or celebrity content, they have an Interesting Trivia section attached to it. 
This section is very popular and gets oftenly shared by the users.
Not only these but we can see use cases of Interesting Trivias in sports domain as well.
Various sports commentators tell Interesting Trivias about that sport throughout the match to keep viewers engaged.
In Spite of such utility of Interesting Trivias, their extraction is still a manual process.
Statisticians are paid to extract Interesting Trivias from the data. 
Efforts to mine Interesting Trivias from the data, rather than hiring professionals to curate material, are motivated not only by cost and scalability but also reliability and freshness.
We propose a system which automatically extracts Interesting Trivias from given data.
Also we are presenting it to you with a nice UI made with Dash - Plotly. You can see Dash-App Gallery https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/  here.
Our project takes input as .csv file as presenting results on Dash App made with python.
For running project you should have python 3.x version installed and all dash related libraries.
On terminal just type command : python index.py
